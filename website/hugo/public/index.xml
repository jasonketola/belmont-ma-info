      <description>Raising revenue: The golf course The Belmont Country Club pays 25% of the tax rate for most of their land (the golf course). This is due to MA general law 61B.
Watch this presentation of the Board of Assessorsto the Warrant Committee (starting at 42:43) on March 3, 2021 for some discussion of this.
This issue has been around since the late 1970s.
The Structural Change Impact Group has had lobbying the state to change this law added to their list of ideas they will evaluate and potentially pursue.</description>

      <description>If, like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been frustrated or confused by Belmont&amp;rsquo;s assessments or property taxes (e.g., why do they go up in Q3?) , I highly recommend watching this presesentation by the Board of Assessors to the Warrant Committee and the associated Q&amp;amp;A. It starts just before the two minute mark. I found it to be incredibly helpful and I learned a lot, especially from the Q&amp;amp;A.</description>

      <description>The plans  Whether I&amp;rsquo;m elected or not, I plan to release on this site an application that makes it easier to compare the voting records of our town meeting members. This is in the works. The town makes data available publicly, but the data is not consistent and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of clean up to do before one can work with it.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m running for Town Meeting to represent Precinct 3 About me I’ve lived in Belmont for two years with my wife and now with our young daughter. I’m COO at MaxMind, a tech company headquartered in Waltham. My family and I very much enjoy the town, its parks, stores, the library, access to public transit, and the people we’ve met.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m seeking nomination I want to hold the town accountable for how it spends our tax money, and I want to ensure the services we receive in return run well and make sense.</description>
