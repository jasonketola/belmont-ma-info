<p>It would be great to partner with other towns to change this exemption so that we&rsquo;re no longer each subsidizing the country club!</p>
<h2 id="saving-opportunity-the-town-pension-fund">Saving opportunity: The town pension fund</h2>
<p>The town is currently managing the majority of its pension assets itself. This results in an additional ~$1 million expense to the town each year. Warrant Committee member Elizabeth Dionne <a href="https://www.belmontmedia.org/watch/belmont-buzz-elizabeth-dionne-012921">explains the issue</a> and how moving the assets to the <a href="https://www.mapension.com/">MA Pension Reserves Pension Trust</a> would help.</p>
<p>This is another topic that&rsquo;s been raised to the <a href="https://www.belmont-ma.gov/structural-change-impact-group">Structural Change Impact Group</a>. Let&rsquo;s make sure they investigate it and take appropriate action.</p>
