      <description>Raising revenue: The golf course The Belmont Country Club pays 25% of the tax rate for most of their land (the golf course). This is due to MA general law 61B.
Watch this presentation of the Board of Assessorsto the Warrant Committee (starting at 42:43) on March 3, 2021 for some discussion of this.
This issue has been around since the late 1970s.
The Structural Change Impact Group has had lobbying the state to change this law added to their list of ideas they will evaluate and potentially pursue.</description>

      <description>If, like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been frustrated or confused by Belmont&amp;rsquo;s assessments or property taxes (e.g., why do they go up in Q3?) , I highly recommend watching this presesentation by the Board of Assessors to the Warrant Committee and the associated Q&amp;amp;A. It starts just before the two minute mark. I found it to be incredibly helpful and I learned a lot, especially from the Q&amp;amp;A.</description>
