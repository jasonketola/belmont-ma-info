      <description>Explanation of opposition The demolition delay bylaw amendment (Article 4) that came before Town Meeting last night makes permanent what was a temporary demolition delay bylaw. The bylaw imposes a 12 month delay on developers who want to demolish buildings that are on the historic register. The amendment passed with a strong majority.
I wanted Town Meeting to oppose the amendment so the bylaw would expire, and I did a bad job of explaining reasons I believe we should have opposed it.</description>
