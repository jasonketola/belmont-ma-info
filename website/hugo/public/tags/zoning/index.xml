      <description>Belmont has a plan to update its multifamily zoning in the next couple years This is a late update, but I was pleased to read in the January 20, 2022 minutes of The Housing Trust that there&amp;rsquo;s a plan for responding to the state&amp;rsquo;s Multifamily Zoning Law. According to plan, we ought to have more multifamily zoning by the end of 2023.
It is important to increase the housing supply in Belmont, which is dominated by single family homes, to address the twin issues of the difficulty of buying into the town and also the difficulty of staying in town for those whose wealth is locked up in expensive single family homes with high property taxes.</description>
