      <description>Context I&amp;rsquo;ve attended most of the school committee&amp;rsquo;s equity subcommittee meetings since February.

I also wanted to share some goal thoughts for discussion, because that had been a topic at the October 19 meeting and few concrete goal ideas had been shared.</description>
