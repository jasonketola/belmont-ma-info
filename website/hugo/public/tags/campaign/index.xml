      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m running for Town Meeting to represent Precinct 3 About me I’ve lived in Belmont for two years with my wife and now with our young daughter. I’m COO at MaxMind, a tech company headquartered in Waltham. My family and I very much enjoy the town, its parks, stores, the library, access to public transit, and the people we’ve met.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m seeking nomination I want to hold the town accountable for how it spends our tax money, and I want to ensure the services we receive in return run well and make sense.</description>
