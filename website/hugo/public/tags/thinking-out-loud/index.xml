      <description>Context At the October 13 Diversity Task Force meeting, the idea of removing the overnight parking ban was floated as a way to address a racial and economic equity issue in town. I thought about the issue for several days, and collected my thoughts into an email which I sent to a few of the attendees on October 22. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the body of that email so you can get a sense of my thinking on this issue.</description>

      <description>Context I&amp;rsquo;ve attended most of the school committee&amp;rsquo;s equity subcommittee meetings since February. On October 22, I sent an email to the equity subcommittee with some concerns that what had been described early in the process was not obviously what we were seeing in the implementation. I also wanted to share some goal thoughts for discussion, because that had been a topic at the October 19 meeting and few concrete goal ideas had been shared.</description>
