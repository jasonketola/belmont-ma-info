      <description>Key takeaways  Many of us have wondered if assessments are increasing for everyone. About 26% of residential properties saw decreases in their assessed values between FY2020 and FY2021. (I&amp;rsquo;m defining residential properties as single families, condos, 2 and 3 families.)

      <description>If, like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been frustrated or confused by Belmont&amp;rsquo;s assessments or property taxes (e.g., why do they go up in Q3?) , I highly recommend watching this presesentation by the Board of Assessors to the Warrant Committee and the associated Q&amp;amp;A. It starts just before the two minute mark. I found it to be incredibly helpful and I learned a lot, especially from the Q&amp;amp;A.</description>
