      <description>Context At the October 13 Diversity Task Force meeting, the idea of removing the overnight parking ban was floated as a way to address a racial and economic equity issue in town. I thought about the issue for several days, and collected my thoughts into an email which I sent to a few of the attendees on October 22. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing the body of that email so you can get a sense of my thinking on this issue.</description>
