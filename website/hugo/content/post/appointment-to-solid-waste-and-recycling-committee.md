## Update
I was appointed to the [Solid Waste and Recycling Committee](https://www.belmont-ma.gov/solid-waste-and-recycling-committee). The [committee charge](https://www.belmont-ma.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif6831/f/uploads/solid_waste_and_recycling_committee_charge.pdf) is to "assist the Town in procuring a new collection contract and to consider possible enhancements in recycling efforts."
