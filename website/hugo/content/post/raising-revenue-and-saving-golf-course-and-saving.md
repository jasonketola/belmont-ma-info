## Raising revenue: The golf course

The Belmont Country Club pays 25% of the tax rate for most of their land (the golf course). This is due to MA general law 61B.

[This issue](http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/08/30/teed_off_at_tax_break/#:~:text=Under%20the%20state's%2061B%20exemption,ever%20sold%20to%20a%20developer.&text=Officials%20at%20the%20state%20Department,the%20tax%20break%20across%20Massachusetts.) has been around since the late 1970s.

The [Structural Change Impact Group](https://www.belmont-ma.gov/structural-change-impact-group) has had lobbying the state to change this law added to their list of ideas they will evaluate and potentially pursue.

It would be great to partner with other towns to change this exemption so that we're no longer each subsidizing the country club!

## Saving opportunity: The town pension fund

The town is currently managing the majority of its pension assets itself. This results in an additional ~$1 million expense to the town each year. Warrant Committee member Elizabeth Dionne [explains the issue](https://www.belmontmedia.org/watch/belmont-buzz-elizabeth-dionne-012921) and how moving the assets to the [MA Pension Reserves Pension Trust](https://www.mapension.com/) would help.

This is another topic that's been raised to the [Structural Change Impact Group](https://www.belmont-ma.gov/structural-change-impact-group). Let's make sure they investigate it and take appropriate action.
