If, like me, you've ever been frustrated or confused by Belmont's assessments or property taxes (e.g., why do they go up in Q3?) , I highly recommend watching [this presesentation by the Board of Assessors](https://videoplayer.telvue.com/player/uClcIN88BHKHJoveFoaVN_8_5Tg72P0o/playlists/6556/media/624674?autostart=false&showtabssearch=false&fullscreen=false&jwsource=cl&fbclid=IwAR2z1ZgeiLZF9KlRLabCVW0LetmrS9eC7uGOQHlat8_PcdzXImKDx8KpR7A) to the Warrant Committee and the associated Q&A. It starts just before the two minute mark. I found it to be incredibly helpful and I learned a lot, especially from the Q&A.
