## Context

I've sent the letter below to a few of the different town publications in the hope that it will get published.

## Review hiring practices to help achieve diversity, equity, and inclusion goals

This past summer, I had the privilege of serving on the screening committee for Belmont Public Schools’ Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The experience caused me to reflect on how important hiring practices are to achieving DEI-related goals. I would like to share four strategies for making hiring more inclusive that I have learned over time and have seen work to good effect.

First, job ads and descriptions should include only those job requirements that are strictly necessary to do the job. When writing a job ad, it can be tempting to include a long “wish list” of requirements in the hope of finding a candidate who has learned and experienced everything that could possibly be useful for the new job. Experienced candidates may know to apply even if they don’t meet all the job criteria listed with an ad, but less-experienced or connected applicants often won’t apply in such cases. By doing the hard work of thinking through what your job really requires and narrowing the requirements, you can ensure the widest possible applicant pool.

Second, and related to the above, job requirements should only include educational credential requirements where they are strictly necessary (i.e., legally mandated). Only a subset of today’s professions require particular degrees (e.g., doctors, lawyers), while for most others the necessary skills and experience can be gained in other ways than getting a degree. Requiring degrees can have the effect of excluding people from less-resourced and non-traditional backgrounds from applying. Besides, when hiring, what you really want to know is whether the applicant can do the job you are advertising, not whether they were able to obtain a degree.

Third, ensure that all candidates are treated equally in the hiring process. This means that candidates should not get special reach-outs or get advanced in the hiring process simply because of connections to the hiring committee or higher ups. Applicants from less advantaged backgrounds are less likely to have such connections, and so are disadvantaged in the hiring process when candidates with connections get special treatment.

Fourth, write out the criteria you will use to evaluate candidates ahead of starting the hiring process or at least write a sketch of what a successful candidate will look like. Being thoughtful ahead of time can help you make sure you are not being swayed by biases that can present themselves in the hiring process.

These are some of the strategies I have seen successfully make hiring more inclusive where I work and in reports from other companies. I encourage the town, the Belmont Public Schools, and anyone involved in hiring generally to review their hiring policies and look for these and other opportunities to make positive change.
