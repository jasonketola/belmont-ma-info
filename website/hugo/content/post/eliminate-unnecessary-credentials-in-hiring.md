## Making Belmont hiring more inclusive by eliminating unnecessary credential requirements

Recent stories in the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-jobs-no-college-degree-necessary-11649371535) and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/business/hiring-without-college-degree.html) discuss how companies are eliminating unnecessary degree requirements for jobs and are moving to testing directly whether applicants can do the jobs advertised. [Maryland](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-17/maryland-is-taking-a-stand-against-the-overvalued-college-degree?sref=htOHjx5Y) is doing the same by eliminating unnecessary degree requirements for many state level jobs.

By eliminating unnecessary credential requirements, Belmont and Belmont Public Schools can make their hiring processes more inclusive, in particular to those who come from lower socio-economic backgrounds. I [continue to believe]({{< ref "review-hiring-practices-to-help-achieve-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-goals" >}} "Belmont Citizen-Herald Article on DEI") this is kind of change is low-hanging fruit for Belmont as it seeks to address diversity, equity, and inclusion.
