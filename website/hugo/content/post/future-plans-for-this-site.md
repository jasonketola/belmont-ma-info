## The plans
* Whether I'm elected or not, I plan to release on this site an application that makes it easier to compare the voting records of our town meeting members. This is in the works. The town makes data available publicly, but the data is not consistent and there's a lot of clean up to do before one can work with it.
* I also plan to share write-ups of information I've collected and my associated thoughts on issues related to the town (e.g., items related to the DPW yard, financial calculations).
